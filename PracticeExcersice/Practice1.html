        <p>You'll need this tag at the beginning of every HTML document you create. It ensures that a browser knows that it's
        reading HTML, and that it expects HTML5, the latest version.
        <br><br>
        Even though this isn't actually an HTML tag, it's still a good one to know.</p>

    <div class="html">
        <h1><b>&lt;html&gt;</b></h1>
        <hr size="5px" color="black"/>
        <br>
        <p>This is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading HTML. The &lt;html&gt; tag goes straight after the DOCTYPE tag, and
        you close it with a
        
        &lt;html&gt; tag right at the end of your file. Everything else in your document goes between these tags.
    </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="head">
        <h1><b>&lt;head&gt;</b></h1>
        <hr size="5px" color="black"/>
        <br>
        <p>
            The &lt;head&gt; tag starts the header section of your file. The stuff that goes in here doesn't appear on your webpage.
            Instead, it contains metadata for search engines, and info for your browser.
